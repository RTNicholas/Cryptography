Railfence Guide: 
-------------------
======================
Outline:
Given a cipher text (CT), a number of rails and a number of offsets (colour coded in spreadsheet), the system produces the  relevant decrypted text. 

This is done by first considering a transposition cipher as an encryption of position. Converting every letter to its position and calculating the necessary position plain text position. 
======================
Final Comments:
Decryption must be done by brute force under assumption that the relevant keys exists within a reasonable level of brute force attempts. This could be improved by vba code to automate this.
