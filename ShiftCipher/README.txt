Caesar/Shift Cipher Guide:

======================
Function Outline:
Given an input cipher text (CT), this function attempts to find a pattern between the most frequent letters of the CT and English. This is done by assuming the most frequent letter of the CT is “e” (the most frequent English letter) and trying to find a shift that would match other frequent CT letters with English. 

======================
Final Comments:
Although overly simplistic this system is often correct. Additional systems could be input such as automatically decryption the text and giving multiple possible decryptions. The main flaw is limited text size or texts with large amount of words that distort the overall frequency of letters in English.
